## Dataset


### MRI data

This dataset contains fMRI data from five subjects ('sub-01', 'sub-02', 'sub-03', 'sub-04', and 'sub-05'). Each subject data contains three types of MRI data.

- 'ses-training': fMRI data from the natural image presentation experiment for the decoder training (20 runs; 3 sessions)
- 'ses-testNoCategory': fMRI data from the test image presentation experiment in no-prior condition (2 runs; 1 sessions)
- 'ses-testCategory': fMRI data from the test image presentation experiment in category-prior condition (2 runs; 1 sessions)




Each scanning session consisted of functional EPI images covered the entire brain (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 43 ms; flip angle, 80°; voxel size, 2 × 2 × 2 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm; number of slices, 76; slice gap, 0 mm; multiband factor, 4) .
The dataset also includes a T1-weighted anatomical reference image for each subject (TR, 2250 ms; TE, 3.06 ms; TI, 900 ms; flip angle, 9°; voxel size, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm; FOV, 256 × 256 mm).
The T1-weighted images were scanned only once for each subject in a separate scanning session and are stored in 'ses-anatomy' directories.
The T1-weighted images were defaced by pydeface (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydeface>).
All DICOM files are converted to Nifti-1 files by mri_convert in FreeSurfer.



### Task event files

Task event files ('sub-\*_ses-\*_task-\*_run-\*_events.tsv') contains recorded event during fMRI runs. Each column of the task event files represents:

- 'onset': onset time of an event (sec)
- 'duration': duration of the event (sec)
- 'trial_type': type of the event (1: Stimulus presentation block, 2: Repetition block, -1 and -2: Initial and post rest blocks without visual stimulus)
- 'stimulus_name': stimulus file name of the image presented in a stimulus block ('n/a' in rest blocks)
- 'category_index': category ID of the images presented in a stimulus block of the category-prior condition (1 in the other conditions) 
- 'image_index': stimulus ID of the image presented in a stimulus block ('n/a' in rest blocks)
- 'button_response': pressed button by the subject at the block, 1: uncertainty and 2: certainty for testNoCagegory and testCategory experiment, and 1: one-back repetition for training experiment ('n/a' or 0.0 when the subject did not press the button in the block)
- 'response_time': time of button press at the block, elapsed time (sec) from the beginning of each run ('n/a' or 0.0 when the subject did not press the button in the block)


### Stimulus images

Due to license issues, our dataset do not include the stimulus images used in the experiments.
